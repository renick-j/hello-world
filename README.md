# hello-world
This is my first github thing

Hi! 
I'm an earthling of Japanese and Canadian descent. 
So far, I lived my entire life in Japan and I'm dreaming to live a nnomad like life for my rest of my life. 
I just graduated from high school, so I guess now is the time to have my first step to pursue that life style!
